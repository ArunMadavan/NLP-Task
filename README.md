Given a dataset of customer reviews for a product, the objective is to perform sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify the overall sentiment of the customers towards the product. The insights obtained from this analysis will help the business in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the product and make informed decisions about its future development and marketing strategies.

For this task, Python will be used as the programming language along with NLP toolkits such as NLTK, Textblob, Spacy. The sentiment analysis will involve preprocessing the text data, identifying the sentiment polarity of each review using a machine learning model, and finally aggregating the results to obtain an overall sentiment score for the product.

The business value of this project lies in the insights gained from the sentiment analysis, which can inform decisions on product development and marketing strategies
